🌦️ Weather Data Visualization 📊
Project Overview:
This repository hosts weather data and Power BI visualization files, offering insights into historical weather patterns. Dive into various weather metrics over time, identifying trends, anomalies, and correlations within the data.

Power BI Proficiency 📈:
Working extensively with Power BI, I've mastered this powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. From connecting to diverse data sources to crafting interactive reports and dashboards, I enable data-driven decision-making.

Data Source 📉:
Utilizing Kaggle's weather dataset, I delve into meteorological variables like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. This comprehensive dataset spans multiple years and is provided in CSV format.

Data Preprocessing 🧹:
Preparing the weather data involved meticulous preprocessing tasks: handling missing values, standardizing units, and aggregating data across different time intervals. I ensure data integrity for robust analyses.

Visualizations 📈:
The Power BI visualization report features a diverse range of charts and graphs, including:

📊 Bar charts illustrating Precipitation by month, Relative Humidity, and Pressure Tendency by month.
🍩 A Donut chart showcasing Sum of DewPoint Temperature by Month.
🔄 A Funnel chart highlighting Average Dewpoint Temperature by Quarter.
