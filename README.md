# Weather-Data-Visualisation

Porject overview:
This repository contains weather data and Power BI visualization files for exploring and analyzing historical weather patterns. The visualization reports created in Power BI offer insights into various weather metrics over time, allowing users to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations within the data.

Power BI:
Working extensively with Power BI has allowed me to become proficient in using this powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. I've learned how to connect to various data sources, clean and transform data, and create interactive reports and dashboards that facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Data Source:
The weather data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, covering a range of meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. The dataset spans multiple years and is provided in CSV format.

Data Preprocessing:
Preparing the weather data for visualization involved various preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, standardizing units, and aggregating data over different time intervals. I've become proficient in data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, ensuring the quality and integrity of the data used in my analyses.

Data Preprocessing:
The weather data underwent preprocessing steps to clean and format the dataset for visualization purposes. This included handling missing values, standardizing units, and aggregating data where necessary.

Visualizations:
The Power BI visualization report includes a range of charts and graphs, including:

Bar charts illustrating Precipitation by month and relative humiidity and pressure tendency by month.
A Donut chart Sum of DewPoint Temperature by Month.
A Funnel chart showing Average of Dewpoint Temperature by Quater.
